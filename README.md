# Jackrabbit-clone-scripts

Two scripts for helping adding new instances to a Jackrabbit cluster: 

1) To make a consistent backup of a jackrabbit instance (it has to be shut down, so it's preferably an instance in a cluster) 
2) To start a new instance in a jackrabbit cluster with the backup made in the first script
